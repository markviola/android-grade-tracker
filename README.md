#Report Card

Track your grades over your academic career with this app. The app allows the user to separate courses between semesters so that they can get a clearer picture of how they are currently doing in their school work. Additional features include bulk mark adding with similar names (i.e "Quiz #1", "Quiz #2", "Quiz #3", etc) and incorporating an optional grade section marking scheme which only takes the top number of marks to be calculated.
